Hello,

Hope all are doing well. We are moving forward to the second round of tasks. There are two activities to complete:

Create a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for an Education Consultancy.

Develop a Website for Exam Registration with Subject Carting and Invoice Generation. 
For the website, incorporate payment integration. The subjects available for registration should include Cambridge IGCSE, AS, 
and A Level subjects. Please note that the subjects offered may vary based on the level (IGCSE, AS, A Level).

Should you have any questions or require clarification on any aspect of these tasks, please do not hesitate to reach out.

The last date for submission is on Monday.
